# Feathers React Components

[Feathers](https://feathersjs.com) is an elegant, flexible, and powerful nodejs backend API layer that is a pleasure to work with. Feathers React Components was created to leverage the app/service model that makes feathers so easy to work with. 

Feathers React Components is a set of components that make building [Feathers](https://feathersjs.com) frontends in React as delightful as building Feathers backends (and vanilla javascript, using the client library). 

## Awesome ü§ò Show me a contrived example!

```jsx
import React, { Component } from "react";
import { FeathersAppProvider, FeathersQuery } from "feathers-rc";
import TodoList from "./TodoList";

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <FeathersAppProvider host={"localhost"} port={3030}>
        <FeathersQuery service={"todos"} query={{ complete: false }} realtime>
          {({ data }) => <TodoList todos={data} />}
        </FeathersQuery>
      </FeathersAppProvider>
    );
  }
}
export default App;
```
## üôã I have some questions!

### ‚ùî What is Feathers?

[Feathers](https://feathersjs.com) is a nodejs API layer that provides a standardized way to create REST and websocket (via socketio or primus) CRUD APIs that can be transparently be backed by a variety of storage solutions such as in-memory, browser localstorage, mongodb, most flavors of SQL, and more. 

A feathers app can easily be configured to provide realtime websocket events for CRUD transactions as well as allowing for custom events. 

This barely scratches the surface of what Feathers is. If you're not familiar, I'd strongly encourage you to learn a bit more about feathers before you look at Feathers React Components. 

### üéØ What does Feathers React Components do for me?

Feathers React Components allows you to consume Feathers APIs, including (optionally) automatic handling of realtime updates. 

All FRC components must be wrapped by a `<FeathersAppProvider>` component, which either accepts or creates a Feathers app instance. `<FeathersAppProvider>` uses the React Context API to provide the app to FRC components. 

`<FeathersAppProvider>` provides a reference to the app along with websocket connection status information. 

The `<FeathersGet>`, `<FeathersQuery>`, and `<FeathersFindOne>` (the query components) each recive a query and uses the render prop pattern to pass down fetch state, errors, and nomalized results along with a reference to the app. 

All of the query components have a boolean input prop called `realtime`, which enables realtime updates (see below for more). 

### üîÑ How do realtime updates work?

When a query component is mounted with the `realtime` prop set to `true`, it registers a listener for each of the Feathers service event types (`create`, `remove`, `update`, and `patch`). 

When a `create` or `remove` event is received, the query is simply re-executed as there's no way to know how the results of the query would be affected. 

When a `patch` or `update` event is received, the data stored within the query component's internal state updated to reflect the change. 

Listeners are automatically cleaned up when the component unmounts  

## ‚ö†Ô∏è !!!! IMPORTANT !!!!!

- Please note that this package is in early development and is **not production ready!!!**

- Some features are **not yet implemented**. 

- If you look at the current testing situation, you will be sad. 
  

## ‚§µÔ∏è Installation

`npm install --save feathers-rc`

## üì¶ Components

### \<FeathersAppProvider>

Uses the context api to provide access to the.
This component _must_ wrap all other feathers-rc components.

```jsx
<App>
  <FeathersAppProvider host={example.com} port={3030}>
    ... your secret sauce
  </FeathersAppProvider>
</App>
```
